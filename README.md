# The Lewis Game, a Tamagochi-Style Flat Mate
After moving out of my house share I decided to recreate the antics of my house mate Lewis in the form of a python tamagochi

# Setup
1. Open a command window in the working directory of the python project
2. Call "python lewis.py"
3. ??
4. PROFIT!

# Description
The aim is to look after your Lewis by feeding him and keeping him entertained.
As Lewis' Hunger and Entertainment levels drop you'll see different images displayed to show you your Lewis' status.
If any of Lewis' stats drop bellow 0 for too long he will go to the pub, thus making you loose the game.

You start the game with 3 beers which will reset Lewis' values to their maximum so use wisely!
As you play, there is a 1/100 chance you can be given more beers at different intervals.

Randomly during your play, you will encounter the evil Goose living in Lewis' house pipes, he will attempt to attack you.
Defeat the Goose by spamming the attack button, if he defeats you, Lewis will feel neglected and go to the pub, thus making you loose the game.
